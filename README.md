# Rock Image Analyzer - AI-Powered Geological Analysis

A Python application that uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash AI model to perform comprehensive geological analysis of rocks in images. Features professional-grade rock classification, detailed mineralogical assessment, and location-aware geological interpretation.

## Features

- **Professional Geological Classification**: Uses standardized geological terminology and classifications (rock classes, Wentworth scale, weathering grades, etc.)
- **Location-Aware Analysis**: Optional location context enhances identification accuracy with regional geological knowledge
- **Comparison Mode**: Analyze with and without location to see the impact of contextual information
- **Structured JSON Output**: Standardized discrete fields for programmatic parsing plus flexible descriptive fields
- **Fast Analysis**: ~20-40 seconds per image using Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Two Analysis Modes**:
  - `rock_analyzer.py`: Comprehensive geological analysis with professional standardization
  - `quick_analyzer.py`: Faster simplified analysis with basic categorization

## Usage

### Comprehensive Geological Analysis

```bash
python rock_analyzer.py path/to/image.jpg

# With location context
python rock_analyzer.py rocks.jpg --location "Grand Canyon, Arizona"

# Save results to JSON
python rock_analyzer.py rocks.jpg --location "Utah" --save

# Compare with/without location
python rock_analyzer.py rocks.jpg --location "Yosemite" --compare
```

### Quick Analysis

```bash
python quick_analyzer.py path/to/image.jpg

# With location and comparison
python quick_analyzer.py rocks.jpg --location "Hawaii" --compare --save
```

## Output Format

### Rock Classification Fields

**Discrete Standardized Fields** (for programmatic parsing):
- `rock_class`: igneous_volcanic, sedimentary_clastic, metamorphic_foliated, etc.
- `size_class`: Wentworth scale (pebble, cobble, boulder, etc.)
- `grain_size`: cryptocrystalline to pegmatitic
- `weathering_grade`: fresh to residual_soil
- `hardness_class`: very_soft to very_hard (Mohs scale)
- `primary_structure`: massive, layered, vesicular, etc.
- `geological_context`: in_situ_outcrop, float, talus, etc.

**Flexible Descriptive Fields** (geological expertise):
- `specific_rock_name`: Detailed rock identification
- `mineral_assemblage`: Visible minerals
- `texture_description`: Comprehensive texture analysis
- `field_notes`: Professional observations
- `likely_formation`: Geological formation if identifiable

#### With Location (Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest, Utah):
- **Total specimens identified**: 7
- **Specific formations**: Paleozoic marine carbonate formation
- **Tectonic context**: Laramide Orogeny and Basin and Range extension
- **Additional specimens**: Identified unconsolidated material and possible Cambrian Tintic Quartzite fragments
- **Confidence levels**: Generally higher (0.60-0.95)

#### Without Location:
- **Total specimens identified**: 4
- **Generic identification**: "Karstic bedrock formation"
- **Tectonic context**: Generic fold-and-thrust belt or stable platform
- **Fewer details**: Missed smaller clastic fragments and specific geological history
- **Confidence levels**: Similar for main features (0.70-0.95)

**Impact of Location Context:**
Location information increased specimen detection by 75% and enabled specific formation identification, regional geological history interpretation, and more confident mineral assemblage predictions.
