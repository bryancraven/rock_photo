# Rock Image Analyzer - AI-Powered Geological Analysis

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT** - This is an amateur hobby tool. Rock identifications are AI-generated and should not be considered authoritative geological assessments.

An amateur Python project that uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro AI model to identify and analyze rocks in images. This is an experimental tool developed as part of a wider hobby project, attempting to use established geological classification standards where possible.

## Features

- **Geological Classification Attempt**: Tries to apply standardized geological terminology (rock classes, Wentworth scale, weathering grades, etc.)
- **Location-Aware Analysis**: Optional location context to potentially improve identification accuracy
- **Comparison Mode**: Analyze with and without location to see the impact of contextual information
- **Structured JSON Output**: Discrete fields for programmatic parsing plus descriptive fields
- **Analysis Time**: ~60-80 seconds per image using Gemini 2.5 Pro with thinking mode
- **Two Analysis Modes**:
  - `rock_analyzer.py`: Detailed geological analysis attempting to use standard classifications
  - `quick_analyzer.py`: Faster simplified analysis with basic categorization

## Installation

- `size_class`: Wentworth scale (pebble, cobble, boulder, etc.)
- `grain_size`: cryptocrystalline to pegmatitic
- `weathering_grade`: fresh to residual_soil
- `hardness_class`: very_soft to very_hard (Mohs scale)
- `primary_structure`: massive, layered, vesicular, etc.
- `geological_context`: in_situ_outcrop, float, talus, etc.

**Flexible Descriptive Fields** (AI interpretation):
- `specific_rock_name`: Detailed rock identification
- `mineral_assemblage`: Visible minerals
- `texture_description`: Comprehensive texture analysis
- `field_notes`: AI-generated observations
- `likely_formation`: Geological formation if identifiable

    }
  ]
}
```

**Key Findings:**
- Identified as tufa (freshwater carbonate deposits) based on vesicular texture
- Spring system deposit with rapid CO2 degassing
- High porosity from encrusted organic matter that decayed
- This is an **experimental hobbyist analysis** - AI-generated identifications should not be considered authoritative

### Comparison Mode Results

The `--compare` flag analyzes the same image both with and without location context to show how geographical information influences AI identification. This is useful for understanding potential biases in the experimental model.

<details>
<summary><b>üîÑ Example: Comparison Analysis Impact</b></summary>

When analyzing the same rock sample with and without location context, the results can vary significantly:

#### With Location Context:
- AI may bias toward regionally common rock types
- Incorporates known geological formations from the area
- Higher confidence in tectonic and depositional interpretations
- May overlook contradictory visual features

#### Without Location Context:
- Relies purely on visual texture and mineralogy
- More objective feature-based identification
- Lower confidence in formation names and ages
- May miss regional geological context

**Example Impact:**
In one test with Utah tufa deposits, location context caused the AI to identify them as limestone (common in the region) despite distinctive tufa characteristics visible in the image. Without location, it correctly identified the vesicular texture as tufa from a spring system.

**Note:** This experimental hobbyist tool's identifications can be influenced by location biases and should not be considered authoritative.

======================================================================
GEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS REPORT
======================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
  Total specimens: 6
  Dominant lithology: igneous_plutonic
  Secondary lithology: igneous_volcanic
  Average grain size: mixed
  Weathering assessment: Slight to moderate weathering, dominated by
    mechanical abrasion (fluvial rounding) with minor chemical oxidation
  Location: banks of Boise River near Boise, Idaho

GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION:
  Setting: Fluvial gravel bar or terrace deposit on the banks of the
    Boise River, within the western Snake River Plain.
  Tectonic context: The mixed rock assemblage reflects multiple tectonic
    events: Cretaceous subduction-related magmatism (Idaho Batholith) and
    Cenozoic extensional tectonics and hotspot-related volcanism (Snake
    River Plain).

ECONOMIC GEOLOGY: These types of fluvial deposits are a primary source
  of aggregate. Historically, the Boise River basin has been a site for
  placer gold mining, with gold eroded from lode deposits within the
  Idaho Batholith.

## Example Analysis: Boise River Rocks

The repository includes a sample image of river rocks from the banks of the Boise River near Boise, Idaho. This **experimental hobbyist analysis** demonstrates how the AI model identifies multiple rock types from different geological eras:

**Command used:**
```bash
python rock_analyzer.py ABAB3BF2-B388-419F-8646-298FB9881E9C_1_105_c.jpeg \
  --location "banks of Boise River near Boise, Idaho" --save
```

**Results:** The AI identified 6 specimens including:
- **Granite/Granodiorite cobbles** from the Cretaceous Idaho Batholith (~100 million years old)
- **Basalt pebbles** from the Neogene Snake River Plain Group (hotspot volcanism)
- Mixed assemblage showing multi-tectonic event history

The analysis correctly interpreted the fluvial depositional environment and even noted the historical placer gold mining significance of the area.
